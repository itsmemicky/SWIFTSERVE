SWIFTSERVE

Swift: Represents agility, responsiveness, and time-saving. In the catering world, 
"Swift" means a client gets a quote in minutes, not days, and an event is organized without delays.

Serve: This is the soul of the industry. It represents the act of catering, 
but also the technical "server" that hosts the system. It bridges the gap between 
digital efficiency and human hospitality.
